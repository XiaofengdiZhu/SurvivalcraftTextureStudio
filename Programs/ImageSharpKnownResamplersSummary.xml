  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Bicubic">
    <summary>
      Gets the Bicubic sampler that implements the bicubic kernel algorithm W(x)
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Box">
    <summary>
      Gets the Box sampler that implements the box algorithm. Similar to nearest neighbor when upscaling.
      When downscaling the pixels will average, merging pixels together.

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.CatmullRom">
    <summary>
      Gets the Catmull-Rom sampler, a well known standard Cubic Filter often used as a interpolation function
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Hermite">
    <summary>
      Gets the Hermite sampler. A type of smoothed triangular interpolation filter that rounds off strong edges while
      preserving flat 'color levels' in the original image.

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.MitchellNetravali">
    <summary>
      Gets the Mitchell-Netravali sampler. This seperable cubic algorithm yields a very good equilibrium between
      detail preservation (sharpness) and smoothness.
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.NearestNeighbor">
    <summary>
      Gets the Nearest-Neighbour sampler that implements the nearest neighbor algorithm. This uses a very fast, unscaled filter
      which will select the closest pixel to the new pixels position.
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Robidoux">
    <summary>
      Gets the Robidoux sampler. This algorithm developed by Nicolas Robidoux providing a very good equilibrium between
      detail preservation (sharpness) and smoothness comparable to <see cref="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.MitchellNetravali"/>.
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.RobidouxSharp">
    <summary>
      Gets the Robidoux Sharp sampler. A sharpened form of the <see cref="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Robidoux"/> sampler
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Spline">
    <summary>
      Gets the Spline sampler. A separable cubic algorithm similar to <see cref="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.MitchellNetravali"/> but yielding smoother results.
    </summary>

  <member name="P:SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.KnownResamplers.Triangle">
    <summary>
      Gets the Triangle sampler, otherwise known as Bilinear. This interpolation algorithm can be used where perfect image transformation
      with pixel matching is impossible, so that one can calculate and assign appropriate intensity values to pixels
    </summary>
